# Project-Horkos

Package for neural network implemetation for Ichanaea dashboard. 
This repo can be found at https://github.com/devalk96/Ichnaea.
Contains classes to train the networks. 

This package won't work in and off itself seeing as it need some of the data from Ichanaea like the datasets.

The package was removed seeing as the networks failed to outperform a linear model and increased the build time by a large margin.
